Welcome to the Jet Management Center!
=====================================

Jet Management Center allows you to monitor a running Jet cluster and get
diagnostics information about currently running jobs.

Cluster Configuration
---------------------

Before starting the management center, you need to configure it to connect to
your cluster. The management center uses the Jet client so it can be configured
in the same way as a normal client. You can edit the provided "hazelcast-client.xml"
file to update the cluster information.

License Key Configuration
-------------------------

Jet Management Center is free for single node deployments, but requires a license
key when used with more than one node. To update the license key, edit the relevant
option inside the supplied application.properties file.


Starting Jet Management Center
------------------------------
To start the Jet Management Center you can use the following command:

java -jar hazelcast-jet-management-center-VERSION.jar

After this, you should be able to access it at the given URL at http://localhost:8081

To configure the port number and/or use HTTPS, the required options are available inside
the application.properties file.
